Part 1
======
The following modifications were applied to each of the three HTML files in Part 1:

* The `<style>` block in `<head>` was removed.
* Inline `style` attributes in all HTML tags were removed.
* In `<head>`, a `<link>` was added that referenced `style.css` to provide styling to the different elements of the document:
    * The background color was set to a linear gradient that mimics the gradual yellowing of a book over time. The more recent "pages" of the book are more yellow since they are read more often than later "pages".
    * Serif fonts are used throughout the document to improve readability. Letter spacing is also set for this purpose.
    * Margins are set around the book text to simulate typical margin sizes in print.
    * Figures and figure captions are styled to appear centered on-page with appropriate margins before and after them.
